/******************************* REGINA OVERVIEW *********************************/
Regina is a free, practical RTOS. Now it supports include STM32 F1/F4F/F7 series. 
As a tiny RTOS, Regina does not have various modules. However, it still provides 
basic universal functions for user, like soft-timer, message queue and semaphore. 
Because of its small body, it runs very fast and stable.

<1> Characters of Regina task are listed as follows:
	1) wide range of task priority (0u(max) - 65535u(min)).
	2) both the preemptive priority and the time slice rotation are supported.
	3) task can be operated in interrupt service routines or ISR.
	4) task does not involve dynamic memory allocation during running.

<2> Characters of Regina soft-timer are listed as follows:
	1) it supports single and periodic timer mode.
	2) its function argument and timer period can be dynamically changed.
	3) its call-back function is invoked under protection.

<3> Characters of Regina message queue are listed as follows:
	1) message passing does not involve dynamic memory allocation.
	2) it uses circular queue to store messages.
	3) message can be sent in ISR.

<4> Characters of Regina semaphore are listed as follows:
	1) the type of semaphore include mutex and binary (lock).
	2) type of mutex solved the problem of priority inversion.
	3) type of binary (lock) can be released in ISR.

This version of Regina is 3.0. I finished it in 2019/06/29. The reason I have to 
write it is that previous versions all have some problems. In this version, I've 
changed a lot to make Regina more practical. I try to avoid using dynamic memory 
allocation to improve the real-time performance of Regina. Meanwhile, I also 
optimized the code to support the CLANG and GCC Compiler. For me, The new version 
of Regina is the best gift for my graduation.

If you're interested in it, just download and have a test on your board. You can 
find some simple examples in Regina/doc/ directory. Of course, if you wanna 
transplant it to another platform, it does not need to do too many works. For you 
interesting guys, send me a email if you have problems about use of Regina. I'd 
try my best to help you if I know. Here is my email account: 1161985414@qq.com 
I look forward to your email.
